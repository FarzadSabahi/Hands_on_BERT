# Hands-On BERT Using PyTorch

This project demonstrates how to use the BERT model with PyTorch for sequence classification tasks. We will delve into the power of BERT, leveraging it for classifying sentences in a dataset. The repository provides scripts for training a model, evaluating its performance, and making predictions on new data.

## Requirements

To install and run this project, you'll need:

- Python 3.7 or later
- PyTorch 1.8 or later
- Transformers library
- CUDA (Recommended for faster training with GPU acceleration)

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

    pip install torch torchvision transformers

## Dataset

This project assumes you have a basic dataset for sequence classification. The dataset should include two files:

    train.csv: The training dataset containing the sequences and labels.
    test.csv: The test dataset used for evaluating the model.

Each dataset should be structured with headers: sequence for the input text and label for the corresponding classification.

##Usage
__Model Training:__ Run the training script to begin training the BERT model on your dataset. You can specify parameters like batch size and number of epochs:
    python train.py --batch_size 16 --epochs 4

This script will train the BERT model and save the trained model for future use.

__Evaluation:__ After training your model, evaluate its performance on the test dataset with the evaluation script:

    python evaluate.py

This script will provide metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, helping you understand the effectiveness of your model.

__Making Predictions:__ With a trained model, you can make predictions on new data. Run the predict script, passing in new sequences:

    python predict.py --sequence "Your text here"

This will output the model's prediction for the input sequence.
